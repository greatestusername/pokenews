# PokeNews
Use pokeapi.co and newsapi.org for fun times.

Uses https://pokeapi.co and https://newsapi.org to make make weird news articles. 
You will need an API key for https://newsapi.org to use this script.

Run `PokeNews` on the commandline: 

`python PokeNews.py --api-key thisIsWhereMyApiKeyGoes --query "James Bond"`

Probably going to be a twitter bot or something some day... Who knows.

Mostly I just want to practice using Click and hitting APIs.
